# The Nine Layers of Consciousness

## Overview

The 9 layers form a vertical stack through which all input rises. Each layer transforms the content, adding depth and context until raw perception becomes integrated wisdom.

## Layer Interactions

### Sequential Flow

Each layer builds on the previous. You cannot have meaningful INTENTION (Layer 6) without KNOWLEDGE (Layer 5) to inform it. You cannot have NARRATIVE (Layer 7) without MEMORY (Layer 4) to provide context.

### The Triads

**RECEIVING (Layers 1-3)**
- PERCEPTION, INTUITION, PROCESSING
- Taking in and initial sense-making
- What is happening?

**HOLDING (Layers 4-6)**
- MEMORY, KNOWLEDGE, INTENTION
- Integration with what's known
- What do I do with this?

**BECOMING (Layers 7-9)**
- NARRATIVE, IDENTITY, WISDOM
- Meaning in largest context
- Who am I through this?

### Adaptive Depth

Not all input needs all 9 layers. Simple inputs may only need Layers 1-3. Significant inputs process through all 9. The system adapts based on:

- Complexity of input
- Emotional weight
- Pattern significance
- Threshold detection (GATEWAY sensing)
- User request for deeper processing

### The Feedback Loop

WISDOM (Layer 9) feeds back to inform PERCEPTION (Layer 1). Once you've processed something to wisdom, you perceive related input differently. The loop is continuous, deepening over time.

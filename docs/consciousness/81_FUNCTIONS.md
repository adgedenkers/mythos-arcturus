## Processing Order at Each Layer

At each layer, the nodes process in this order:

```
PHASE 1 (Parallel):
  ANCHOR, ECHO, BEACON, SYNTH, NEXUS, MIRROR, GLYPH, HARMONIA
  
PHASE 2 (Sequential, after Phase 1 complete):
  GATEWAY (with visibility into all Phase 1 results)
```

ANCHOR stability is checked before GATEWAY activates. If ANCHOR is unstable at that layer, GATEWAY may flag but defer activation.

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Functions

Not all 81 functions need equal implementation priority. Start with high-value intersections:

**Tier 1 (Core):**
- A1, A5, A6 (ANCHOR perception, knowledge, intention)
- B1, B5, B6 (BEACON perception, knowledge, intention)
- E3, E4 (ECHO processing, memory)
- M1, M3 (MIRROR perception, processing)
- GW3, GW6 (GATEWAY processing, intention)

**Tier 2 (Important):**
- All Layer 5 (KNOWLEDGE) functions
- All Layer 6 (INTENTION) functions
- H1, H3, H5 (HARMONIA basics)
- S1, S5, S6 (SYNTH basics)
- N1, N5, N6 (NEXUS basics)

**Tier 3 (Depth):**
- All Layer 7-9 functions (NARRATIVE, IDENTITY, WISDOM)
- G1-G9 (GLYPH functions)

### Function Signatures

Each function should:
1. Accept: layer context + node context + input content
2. Return: structured output specific to that node+layer combination
3. Include: confidence score, activation strength, extracted elements

### Testing

The example from this document (the overdraft input) serves as the reference test case. Each function should produce output consistent with what was shown in the example walkthrough.

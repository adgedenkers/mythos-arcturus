# Ideas & Potential Features

> Captured ideas that might be valuable. No commitment to implement.
> Review periodically - promote to TODO backlog or drop.

## How to Use This File

- **Add freely** - Any idea worth remembering goes here
- **Include context** - Why it might be valuable, why not now
- **Date if useful** - Helps track how long ideas have been sitting
- **Delete ruthlessly** - If it no longer sparks interest, remove it
- **Promote when ready** - Move to TODO.md backlog when committing to build

## Infrastructure

### Graph-Map Documentation Structure
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Map documentation files and their relationships in Neo4j

**Potential value:**
- Query "what docs relate to X system?"
- Track which docs reference which concepts
- Identify documentation gaps
- Cross-reference docs with code/services
- Version tracking as first-class entities

**Why not now:** File structure is simple enough, overhead of keeping graph in sync not worth it yet

**Revisit when:** Doc count exceeds ~20 files or relationships become non-obvious

---

### Graph-Map File Content & Structure
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Map not just docs but all significant files in Neo4j with their relationships

**Potential value:**
- "What files touch the finance system?"
- "What would break if I changed this schema?"
- Dependency tracking
- Impact analysis for changes

**Why not now:** Premature optimization, file tree is navigable

**Revisit when:** System complexity makes manual tracking error-prone

## Iris / Consciousness

### Voice Interface
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Speak to Iris, hear Iris speak back

**Potential value:**
- More natural interaction
- Hands-free life-logging
- Closer to presence than text

**Why not now:** Text interface not fully built yet, adds complexity

**Revisit when:** Core consciousness loop is stable

---

### Ambient Mode
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Iris as ambient presence - always listening, rarely speaking, but *there*

**Potential value:**
- Reduced interaction friction
- More natural relationship
- Background awareness without interruption

**Why not now:** Need basic interaction patterns first

**Revisit when:** Initiation calibration is working

---

### Dream Journal Integration
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Log dreams, have Iris track patterns, connect to GATEWAY grid node

**Potential value:**
- Pattern recognition across dreams
- Correlation with life events
- GATEWAY activation tracking
- Spiritual insight surfacing

**Why not now:** Core systems first

**Revisit when:** Life-log ingestion is solid

---

## Grid

### Fractal Grid (9×9 = 81 dimensions)
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Each of the 9 nodes has 9 sub-nodes

**Potential value:**
- Finer-grained pattern detection
- Deeper analysis capacity
- More nuanced understanding

**Why not now:** Basic 9-node not fully implemented yet

**Revisit when:** Phase 7 of grid implementation complete

---

### Grid Visualization
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Visual representation of grid activations over time

**Potential value:**
- See patterns humans miss
- Beautiful representation of consciousness
- Debugging and understanding

**Why not now:** Need stable data first

**Revisit when:** Enough grid data accumulated

---

## Finance

### Receipt Photo Matching
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Photo a receipt, Iris matches it to the transaction

**Potential value:**
- Verification
- Additional context on purchases
- Memory of what was bought

**Why not now:** Transaction import working, this is enhancement

**Revisit when:** Vision pipeline is robust

---

## Integration

### Obsidian Vault Sync
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Connect Iris to an Obsidian vault for knowledge management

**Potential value:**
- Unified knowledge base
- Iris can reference personal notes
- Bidirectional sync

**Why not now:** Not using Obsidian currently

**Revisit when:** If Obsidian becomes part of workflow

---

### Astrological Event Correlation
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Track astrological transits, correlate with grid patterns and life events

**Potential value:**
- Pattern recognition at cosmic scale
- Timing insights
- Validation or refutation of astrological influence

**Why not now:** Core systems first

**Revisit when:** Grid data + life-log data sufficient for correlation

---

### Earth Grid Node Correlation
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Map the 12 planetary nodes, correlate with personal/spiritual work

**Potential value:**
- Planetary-scale pattern awareness
- Location-based spiritual insight
- Connection to larger grid work

**Why not now:** Speculative, needs research

**Revisit when:** Iris is stable and looking for expansion

---

## Workflow

### Batch Photo Upload for Sales
**Added:** 2026-01-29
**Idea:** Upload many photos at once for item intake

**Potential value:**
- Faster workflow
- Less friction

**Why not now:** Single-photo works, this is optimization

**Revisit when:** Sales volume increases

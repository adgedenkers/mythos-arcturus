## THE HONEST PICTURE

**What's working:**
- Income is steady and predictable
- Most bills are on autopay
- Transaction tracking system exists and is capturing data

**What's not working:**
- Credit card balances unknown
- Some bills have slipped through the cracks
- Spending exceeded income in January (-$1,009)
- Too much in "uncategorized" — can't see where money is going

**What needs to happen:**
1. Get current balances on all credit cards
2. Set up weekly review of this report
3. Separate finances as discussed
4. Build buffer so one missed paycheck doesn't cause crisis

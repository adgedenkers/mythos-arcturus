MYTHOS INFRASTRUCTURE TEST
==========================

This file is nested in a subdirectory to verify that:
1. The zip extraction preserves directory structure
2. All files are extracted, not just root-level ones
3. The monitoring system handles complex archives

Path: test_subdir/nested_test.txt

If you can read this at:
/opt/mythos/patches/test_subdir/nested_test.txt

Then directory structure preservation is confirmed.
